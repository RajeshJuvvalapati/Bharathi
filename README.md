--> In my acodamic  we implemented   network  project using Java progarming lang.

--> Project name is  Preventing Distributed Denial-of-Service Flooding Attacks with Dynamic Path Identifiers

--> project purpose is  to prevent  DDoS flooding attacks on internet.

--> While transmitting the data from source to destination Ip address, routing address, PID of an inter-domain path connecting two domains is kept secret and changes dynamically.

--> So that the denial-of-service(DDoS) flooding attacks will be reduced.

--> in this project  we  implemeted  frontend as  awt/swings  and   backend as Oracle.  
  and to  perform  CRUD operation on the  oracle data  we have implemetd JDBC logic.

--> We are a team of 4 memebders. i have involved in to implemet  JDBC logic  and    controlller layer.

--> We implemented 2 tables  Nodes table, Router_info  table . Node table contains  Ip address info,Groupid  infomarion,Assignment group info  and router information  table  contains in  nodes information.

--> if we want to transfor file source to destination. first we need to  assign  assignement group for sourse file and  need to validate  assignement signature  before tranformation  source file to destination.  to full fill this  requirement we have implemented   source page using Swings.

--> while  vaidationg Assignmenet  Signature  we will check  assignment group  belongs to which node. once validation sucess  and we will send source file  to that particular  node PID ip address.
